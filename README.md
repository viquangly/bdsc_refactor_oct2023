# BDSC Code Roast

This repo is for the Buffalo Data Science Community (**BDSC**) Code Refactoring Workshop on
4 Oct 2023.  There are 2 main projects being refactored: **NBA** and **Stocks**.
Each project has an ***original*** folder which contains the original code, and a ***refactored***
folder which contains cleaner code.

Look for the ***@BCP*** tag in comments to locate areas of code smells.
Look for the ***@refactored*** tag in comments to locate the refactored code.
